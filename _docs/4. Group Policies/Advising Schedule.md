Each student should have a twice annual review with Ambar. Make sure to address:

1. Are you being productive on the current project? What is going well? What could be improved? What might be slowing you down?

2. Do you have sufficient support to complete your projects? Is your workload to heavy or light?

3. What has Ambar been doing well? What can Ambar do better?

4. What have you been doing well? What can you do better?

5. Do you feel like you are building skills to set you up for your career?

6. What is your timeline for graduation? What is the order of projects and their timeline?
