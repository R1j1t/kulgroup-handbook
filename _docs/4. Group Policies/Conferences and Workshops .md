# Conferences

Going to conferences is a valuable way to share your research, network, and learn about trends in your field. Aim to attend 1-2 conferences per year if possible. If you find a conference you would like to attend, talk to Ambar about it and come up with a plan for what you might present there.

Some conferences or workshops you may want to attend:

- SUNCAT
- NAM
- ACS
- PCCS
