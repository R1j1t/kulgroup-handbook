### Github

Create an account on Github. Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. If you have open-source projects that use Git, then GitHub is designed to help you better manage them (<https://devmountain.com/blog/git-vs-github-whats-the-difference/>).

### Getting started with Git

You do not need GitHub to use git, but you cannot use GitHub without using git. Here's a quick guide on getting started with [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

Here is a tutorial for using git and github via PyCharm: (<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ukhZvOmAtk&t=66s>).
