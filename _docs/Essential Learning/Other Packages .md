### Multiscale Atomisric Zeolite Environment (MAZE)

#### What is MAZE?
MAZE is an open-source python-based package developed in our group, which simplifies workflows for zeolite-related studies. It’s fully compatible with ASE, which means all the ASE functions would also work in the MAZE environment, plus many more. A more comprehensive list of features can be found in the Github link below. If you have any doubts about how some functions work or have suggestions on new functions that should be included, talk to Jiawei.

#### How to download it
Detailed guidelines for installing the package can be found through this link:
